Pillow Runs Itself
==================

As of Pillow 2.6.0, the Pillow project runs itself! Of course when I say "runs itself" I mean "runs without me", which is what every open source project lead hopes for. For the first time ever, I was able to:

- Turn off GitHub Watching until two weeks before the release.
- Not run ``setup.py upload`` or ``twine upload`` myself.
- Watch in awe as the Pillow team did all the work. [1]

Kudos to these gentlemen for making my life easier and for continuing to provide the Python community with a featureful, modern & secure Python Imaging Library.

Additionally thanks to all the contributors from all over the world who continue to develop and improve Pillow. I used to keep a list, but now there are `too many to keep track of <https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/graphs/contributors>`_.
