Pillow Runs Itself
==================

|

As of Pillow 2.6.0, the |Pillow project| runs itself. Of course when I say "runs itself" I mean "runs without me", which is what every open source project lead hopes for. For the first time ever, I was able to:

- Turn off GitHub Watching until two weeks before the release.
- Not run ``setup.py upload`` or ``twine upload`` myself.
- Watch in awe as the Pillow team [1]_ did all the work.

Kudos to them for making my life easier and for continuing to provide the Python community with a featureful, modern & secure Python Imaging Library.

Additional thanks to Christoph Gohlke for |Windows Eggs, Exes, Wheels|, Matthew Brett for |OS X Wheels| and Steve Johnson for |Sphinx Documentation|.


Lastly thanks to all the contributors from all over the world who continue to develop and improve Pillow. I used to keep a list, but now there are |too many to keep track of|.
