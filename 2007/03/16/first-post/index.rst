I have decided to start a blog. Why? Because Plone allows me to do so. But also:

- I have been reading a lot of |planet_plone| lately and they have inspired me to write my own.
- I want to interact with other Plone users.
- I want to use new technology.

To that end, this post is about my |build_tools|. But first I'll note these current and likely better alternatives:

- |buildout|
- ~Buildit~
- ~Instance Manager~

I used Buildout for the first time at the |baarn_sprint| and I've also used Chris McDonough's Buildit. There are even more to choose from, but for now I enjoy typing:

::

    newzope test-site ProductA ProductB ProductC

and having a working instance a few seconds later with Product{A,B,C} installed.
