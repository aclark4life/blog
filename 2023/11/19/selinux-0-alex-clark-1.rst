Introduction
------------

I don’t like to give up on a technical challenge, particularly when the progress is slow-but-consistent. It’s only when I know I can’t make any discernible progress easily or at all that I can force myself to give up. 

Sound familiar? I wrote about a `similar encounter six years ago <https://blog.aclark.net/2017/06/26/saml-1-alex-clark-0.html>`_!

The task at hand
----------------

Now the task at hand is running Samba on Rocky Linux 9. For years I ran File Sharing on a 2010 Mac Pro running Sierra and recent circumstances led me to replace that server with an HP Envy laptop with 11G RAM. It's a surprisingly good server!

It's been a lot of fun building out the services on this laptop running Rocky Linux 9, including:

- Jenkins
- RedHat Cockpit
- Microsoft Remote Desktop 

Having Samba fail mysteriously was not fun, and I should have known better than to go down any rabbit hole without first considering SE Linux, but what can I say? I've been out of the game for a while. Eventually I prevailed and this is the story of that encounter.

Attempts
--------

My recent encounter with Samba on Rocky Linux was embarrasingly long, but it started off normal.

In the beginning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you Google or ChatGPT "Samba on Rocky Linux" you'll get steered toward something like:

::

    sudo dnf install xrdp

Followed by some firewall instructions and, if you are lucky, some SE Linux instructions. If you are unlucky, you will proceed merrily with:

::

    sudo systemctl enable smb
    sudo systemctl start smb

After which you can delight in ``sudo systemctl status smb``:

::

Unfortunately, the joyfulness will end when you try to connect, even though the ports are open:

::

    Password:

I would love to say I immediately recognized the issue as being related to SE Linux, but I didn't. In fact, I went in the opposite direction:

  "Maybe the version of Samba is too old!"

And then there was hombrew, and the brew was good
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My experience with Homebrew on macOS led me to try running Samba on Linux via Homebrew. It worked! The Samba version was newer, and the connection worked fine. Unfortunately I couldn't get systemd to run the Homebrew version of Samba, so after fighting with that for a while, I gave up.

What source have you compiled for me lately?
