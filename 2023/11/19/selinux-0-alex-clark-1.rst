Introduction
------------

I don’t like to give up on a technical challenge, particularly when the progress is slow-but-consistent. It’s only when I know I can’t make any discernible progress easily or at all that I can force myself to give up. 

Sound familiar? I wrote about a `similar encounter six years ago <https://blog.aclark.net/2017/06/26/saml-1-alex-clark-0.html>`_!

The task at hand
----------------

Now the task at hand is running Samba on Rocky Linux 9. For years I ran File Sharing on a 2012 Mac Pro running Sierra and recent circumstances led me to replace that server with an HP Envy laptop with 11G RAM. It's a surprisingly good server!

It's been a lot of fun building out the services on this laptop running Rocky Linux 9, including:

- Jenkins
- RedHat Cockpit
- Microsoft Remote Desktop 

Having Samba fail mysteriously was not a fun, and I should have known better than to go down any rabbit hole without first considering SE Linux, but what can I say I've been out of the game for a while.
